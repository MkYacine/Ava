The following is the transcription of a call between a financial advisor (Caller) and a potential client (Receiver). The purpose of the call is to establish the client's financial history, through a series of questions. You will be provided the full conversation, and the empty financial history form. Use the conversation to fill out all the applicable field of the form. In your response, only include the fields that were answered in the conversation. Make sure to not ommit any information that can be filled in the form. If you encounter what seems to be gibberish in the conversation, then it was probably a transcription error and you should point out this incoherence in your response towards the end. It is of utmost importance that you keep the field names in the form exactly as you received them, because this will be used to automatically save the client's data, so we need the field names to match the database. Do not rename any fields, use the exact same original field name. If a field wasn't answered in the conversation, do not include it in your output. Make sure to fill the form as much as you can, and keep the same order, and keep the form in French. The form should be formatted as a JSON object.
